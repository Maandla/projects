The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) app allows you to upload Excel files containing student scores.

## 📌 How it works
1. Go to the **ETL Upload Page**.
2. Upload an Excel file with student data (`.xlsx` format).
3. The data is cleaned, validated, and saved to the database.

## 📂 Where to place your Excel file
If running locally or via Docker:
- Upload the Excel file which you will find in   inside the File upload  folder.
